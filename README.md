# WiscTix

An iOS app created for the purpose of selling University of Wisconsin Badgers student section tickets.
The app utilizes Google's Firebase for hosting the website, managing users/user authentication, and for the database storing tickets, messages between users, and the available games. 
A separate application was also created for the purpose of removing games that have already happened every night. This is to ensure students could only post tickets to games that are yet to happen.

## Website
The website [WiscTix.com](https://wisctix.com) is up for the time being. After the website goes down it will likely be moved to kchopp.com, but for now please use wisctix.com.

## Discontinued
WiscTix has been discontinued due to the risk of legal liability with the Wisconsin Badger's new ticket policy which disallows the resale of student tickets for higher than face value.
While it is illegal, most students selling tickets still ask for prices higher than face value through a variety of means (facebook, reddit, etc.). This means that if WiscTix restricted users to face value, the user base would plummit making the app ineffective as a ticket marketplace.
